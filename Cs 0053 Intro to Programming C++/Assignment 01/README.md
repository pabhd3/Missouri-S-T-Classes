For this assignment, you will type and submit three (3) algorithms. Make your algorithms clear and concise step-by-step procedures that solve the problems given. I think that each of these should require at least three steps and probably (though, possibly) no more than twenty steps. Think about your answers.

You are driving down the highway. You run over a pair of scissors and the rear tire goes flat tire  . (No, we don't care which one.) You have class in 30 minutes and must get there on time. In order to fix the flat yourself, you need a lug-wrench, a jack, and an inflated spare tire. If you don't have any one of these, you must call for help. Write a step-by-step description of how you are able to continue your drive. If you have never been shown how to repair a flat, have some one in the dorm show you. You never know when you might need this skill!
DO NOT look this up on the web. That would be cheesey.

Write an algorithm to convert decimal numbers to binary.

You all learned how to add two fractions in grade school.  Do you remember how?  Can you teach someone else how?  Thought so ... write an algorithm to instruct how to add two fractions. Of course, you will have to include an explanation of such terms as "least common multiple" or "greatest common divisor" if you use them.
