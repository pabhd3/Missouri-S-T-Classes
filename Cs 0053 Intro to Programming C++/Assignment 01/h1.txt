1. Changing a Flat Tire
  1. Pull a jack, a lug wrench, and inflated tire out of your car.
  2. Place the jack under the car, near the deflated tire.
  3. Raise and lower the lever on the jack to raise the car.
  4. Use the lug wrench to remove all lug bolts on the hubcap of the
  deflated tire. 
  5. Remove the deflated tire from the car.
  6. Put the new inflated tire on the car in the same place the deflated
  tire was.
  7. Use the lug wrench to tighten the lug bolts back into the hubcap.
  8. Lower the jack  so that all four of the car's tires are on the ground.

2. Converting Decimal to Binary
 Notes: When marking 1s and 0s in your binary area, write them from left to
        right.
  1. Divide your base 10 by 2, move to step 2.
  2. If the quotient is an odd number, continue to step 3, if the quotient
     is even, move to step 4. 
  3. Subrtact 1 from the quotient, and mark a 1 in your binary area. Move to
     step 5.
  4. Mark a 0 in your binary area. Continue to step 5.
  5. If your quotient is 1 move to step 6, if your quotient is greater than
     1 go back to step 1. 
  6. Mark the final 1 in your binary area. You have converted your decimal to binary.  

3. Adding Fractions
  1. Multiply the numerator and denominator of fraction A, by the
     denominator of fraction B.
  2. Multiple the numerator and denominator of fraction B, by the
     denominator of fraction A.
  3. Make the product of denominator_A and denominator_b the
     denominator_New.
  4. Add numberator A to numerator B, making numerator_New.
  5. Make numerator_New the numerator of fraction_New.
  6. Make denominator_New the denominator of fraction_New.
  6. Simplify fraction_New, if not already simplified.
