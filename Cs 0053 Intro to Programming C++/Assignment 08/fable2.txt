The ant and the grasshopper fable. One summer's day, a grasshopper was
hopping about, chirping and singing to its heart's content. An ant passed
by, bearing along with great toil a cornkernal he was taking to the nest.
"Why not come and chat with me," said the grasshopper, "instead of toiling
in that way?" "I am helping to lay up food for the winter", said the ant.
"And I recommend you to do likewise." "Why bother about the winter?" said
the grasshopper, "we have plenty of food at the present." But the ant went
on its way and continued its toil. When the winter came the grasshopper saw
the any distributing every day the corn and the grain from the stores they
had collected in the summer. The the grasshopper knew it is best to prepare
for the days of necessity.
